# Main Algorithm

Algorithm is found in Trie.cs

All other files excluding Program.cs are required
- CreateRoot method should be called first
- Insert method should then be called for each city being entered
  - Cities should be lower case
  - Ideally cities should be entered by order of string size
- Search method should then be called with the user search string given as input
    
# Program File

Program.cs is used to run the algorithm
- User search string input is given on line 17
- List of cities can be changed easily in the GetCities method
